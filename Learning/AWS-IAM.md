**WHO** ---> **CAN ACCESS** ---> **WHAT**

What are the **USE CASES**

* Apply fine-grained permissions and scale with attribute-based access control

* Manage per-account access or scale access across AWS accounts and applications

* Establish organization-wide and preventative guardrails on AWS


### Different job functions in AWS

> * You don't have access to all permission
> * An admin gives you permission for the task related to you

2. Service Administrator
> * You are in charge of AWS resource 
> * You call the shots and decide the what the other users gets 

3. IAM Administrator
> *  If you're an IAM administrator, you manage IAM identities and write policies to manage access to IAM.
